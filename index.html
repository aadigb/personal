            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Blockchain and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) have emerged as transformative technologies reshaping the financial sector by introducing transparency, accessibility, and efficiency. However, these technologies face critical challenges, including scalability, high costs, and fragmented user experiences. BASE, a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum developed by Coinbase, is positioned to address these challenges, offering a path to integrate DeFi seamlessly into the global economy. This paper explores the potential of Base to revolutionize both the crypto space and traditional financial systems by enabling a scalable, low-cost, and user-friendly on-chain economy.</p>
